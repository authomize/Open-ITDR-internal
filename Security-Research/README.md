## Okta SCIM attack tool
This tool is based on [#passbleed](https://authomize.com/blog/authomize-discovers-password-stealing-and-impersonation-risks-to-in-okta/#challenges), and allows pen-testers to extract clear text passwords from Okta by abusing Okta's implementation of the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol. The issue allows for clear text password stealing and PII theft. The issue was discovered by [Authomize](https://www.authomize.com/). More information can be found in this [blog post](https://authomize.com/blog/authomize-discovers-password-stealing-and-impersonation-risks-to-in-okta/#challenges).
