# Authomize-ITDR
Authomize is commited to providing open solutions for partners and customers. This repository is based on our API stack providing connections into identities, applications and incidents. Our objective is to provide a mechanism where by using a low code implimentation of [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) automation, workflows for collecting and distributing data can be built.

# Development
Our development platform is based on NodeRed, Authomize may update and change core components as necessary to support the needs of our ITDR projects. Generally speaking most of this code is based on NODE.JS hence javascript is heavily used. Our other solution and utility directories may contain example python and javascript development efforts too. In rare occasions we may choose to provide an as is binary. Our solution directories will contain further detail on guides for building solutions with Authomize ITDR API framework. 

# Third Party Libraries
In some casesd third party libraries may be used, these will be documented in the respective solution repositories, check them out out for further detail however if you need support or information please feel free to submit an issue as outlined above.
