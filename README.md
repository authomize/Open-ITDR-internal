# Authomize Open ITDR
Authomize is commited to providing open solutions for partners and customers. This repository is based on our API stack providing connections into identities, applications and incidents. Our objective is to provide a mechanism where by using a low code implimentation of [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) automation, workflows for collecting and distributing data can be built. Further this respository will contain connectors and application integrations in the form of middleware written as stand along products both in python and javascript.

By committing to the open-source methodology, we recognize that ultimately your contributions in the form of both ideas and code, will be instrumental to the future success of this project. There are a number of ways you can help whether you have software development experience or not. This might be in the form of identifying a bug, having some general feedback or want to request certain features.

## Getting Started
Please refer to the [Wiki page](https://github.com/authomize/Authomize-ITDR/wiki) for instructions on getting started. This will have some references to Auhomize documentation and other information you will need to get started. As we publish solutions we will also include documentation within each directory, this will help in understanding what the use cases are and how to deploy or use any solution provided.

## Development
Our development platform is based on NodeRed, Authomize may update and change core components as necessary to support the needs of our ITDR projects. Generally speaking most of this code is based on NODE.JS hence javascript is heavily used. Our other solution and utility directories may contain example python and javascript development efforts too. In rare occasions we may choose to provide an as is binary. Our solution directories will contain further detail on guides for building solutions with Authomize ITDR API framework. 

## Third Party Libraries
In some casesd third party libraries may be used, these will be documented in the respective solution repositories, check them out out for further detail however if you need support or information please feel free to submit an issue as outlined above.
