This area will contain solutions that provide value to developers and companies trying to find solutions to managing thier IAM infrastructure by collecting information and data from Authomize. We expect two see two types of integrations in this area:

- **Webhooks -** Sends incidents for consumption by other tooling products such as SIEMs, Orchestration or support ticketing systems. Generally there is very little code and sometimes just configuration steps listed here due to the nature of Webhooks. Also be aware that these same tools sometimes have middleware applications built as Platform integrations due to complexity of the use case.
